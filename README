Hi all!

This is my blackjack project, which is, as most projects are, a work in progress. The game rules are fairly simple.  I am currently working on adding a split and a double down function in order to make the game more realistic.  In addition to adding those, I am always looking for ways to modify my code in order to make it more efficient or to make my UI better.

The detailed explanation of the rules of the game can be found here: http://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-rules.php


In order to make this game work, you need to have the image files in a folder called "CardImages", which needs to be located in the root of the project directory. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at jacobgofman@nyu.edu.

Thanks for checking it out!
